KR Popular Posts shows graph of a posts popularity percentage. Popularity based on post views, comments, ratings, retweets and facebook likes ( popular posts sidebar widget included )

== Description ==

KR Popular Posts displays a horizontal graph that represents the popularity of a post based on comments, views, ratings, facebook likes and retweets. Ratings are measured only if GD Star Rating plugin is installed and active. Views look for a "views" custom field and assumes it is tracking the views of the page so any plugin that stores view count using "views" as the post meta will work ( future update will allow you to specify the custom field to use). Facebook likes and retweets require you to setup an hourly cronjob to fetch likes and retweet values for your posts from facebook and twitter. Post popularity is shown with a horizontal bar graph below the post if you check "Use content filtering to append popularity graph". Otherwise you can manually insert the function code where you prefer within your post template page. You can also show a list under the main post popularity graph which displays a graph for the individual item percentages (ie views, ratings, comments, retweets, facebook likes) by checking "Show itemized popularity graphs under main graph". A post's overall popularity and itemized popularity value will rise or fall in relation to the other posts on your site. That means a post with a 50% popularity rating today can have a 30% popularity rating next week if another post increases in views, comments, ratings, retweets, facebook likes by a large enough number to push down the value of the example post's popularity rating. Includes a popular posts widget, with thumbnails or without thumbnails, for your sidebar.
